# my_authentication_page

In This Code -- i create a backend and Frontend web page  for SignUp and Login.....  

When you go to terminal in this file and run the code "npm run dev"  ---> Actually i have used nodemon and in package.json ( Script{
"dev":"nodemon src/app.js" )  -- now when you simply run "npm run dev" this command in terminal then you will see a page in which you can login 
and if you don't have account in this you can signup...
